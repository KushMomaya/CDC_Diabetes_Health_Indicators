## Objective
The objective of the project was to develop a predictive model for diabetes using health indicators. We used various techniques to search for bias and unfairness to demonstrate ethical AI principles. 

## Dataset
The dataset we used comes from the CDC and contains 253,680 entries with 22 distinct health indicators. Chief among these is the Diabetes_binary variable which indicates the presence of diabetes in a patient and is 
our target variable.
